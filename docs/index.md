# Bazooka, a new Generation Continuous Integration and Continous Deployment server

Bazooka is an **Open Source Continuous and Continous Deployment Integration Server** designed to let you install it wherever you want; On your local computer, on dedicated servers within your entreprise network, or on Cloud instances.

## The Philosophy

We believe your build configuration should reside along your code, and be versioned as well. Tools like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) leaded the way.

But most of this tools are hosted services, and the "install yourself" alternatives are few and did not match what we think a Continuous Integration Tool like this should be.

This his How Bazooka was created
