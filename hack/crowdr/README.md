# Crowdr config file for Bazooka

**Linux only, doesn't work on Mac OS X**

The `crowdr.cfg.sh` file provides a configuration to get started with bazooka using crowdr: https://github.com/polonskiy/crowdr.

Once crowdr is installed:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polonskiy/crowdr/0.9.1/crowdr > /usr/local/bin/crowdr
```
 
Simply move to the directory containing the `crowdr.cfg.sh` file and execute the following command:

```
crowdr run
```
