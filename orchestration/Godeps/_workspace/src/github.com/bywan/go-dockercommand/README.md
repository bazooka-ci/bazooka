================

## Note: This is a work in progress

Go Docker Command is a Go library that provides a fluent interface to manage Docker
containers, in the manner of the Docker CLI

We use the great [fsouza/go-dockerclient](https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient)
to communicate with the Docker engine.
